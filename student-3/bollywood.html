        <img src="assets/contentPage/Deewaar.jpg" alt="Deewaar">
        <p class="storyline">
            Evoking ‘Mother India’ with its story of a good son pitched against a bad one and a mother caught between them, ‘Deewaar’ places an anti-hero centrestage. Amitabh Bachchan excels as the simmering Vijay, who turns to criminality to provide for his mum, while brother Ravi (Kapoor) becomes a cop. Inevitably, their paths must cross. ‘Deewaar’ was Bachchan’s first step on the road to mega-stardom and it epitomises his status as the bristling, angry young man railing against all around him.

    <div class="movie">
        <img src="assets/contentPage/Lagaan.jpg" alt="Lagaan">
        <p class="storyline">
            Set in the nineteenth century, ‘Lagaan’ sees a drought-struck village unite, learn to play cricket and take on their cruel imperial rulers. Although the combination of cricket and colonialism seems like a no-brainer in retrospect, at first nobody would touch this script with a bat. Then star Aamir Khan took the lead role and its critical and box office success ushered in a new era of alternative subject matter and varied storytelling. ‘Lagaan’ is, thus far, the last mainstream Hindi film to be nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars.

            Lucknow, 1900. Sahibjaan (Kumari) is a ‘dancing girl’ who marries the respectable Salim (R Kumar), despite his dad’s disapproval. Sahibjaan soon considers herself unworthy of her husband and runs away. Will the lovers be reunited and will ‘respectable society’ accept them? Fifteen years in the making (not helped by personal differences between the director and his leading lady, also his wife), this has an evocative soundtrack which is weaved seamlessly into the story, creating perhaps the most magical, lyrical portrayal of idealised erotic romance seen on the Indian screen. The title means ‘Pure’.

        <img src="assets/contentPage/AmarAkbarAnthony.jpg" alt="Amar Akbar Anthony">
        <p class="storyline">
            The escapist formula honed by director Manmohan Desai (‘Dharam Veer’, Roti’) peaked with this late 1970s film about three brothers – each named in the title – separated at birth. Brimming with clichés and implausible situations, ‘Amar Akbar Anthony’ set the commercial template that many modern Bollywood filmmakers continue to follow. Thirty-five-year-old Amitabh Bachchan, the film’s star, defied his Angry Young Man image – created by a string of sombre action dramas – with his largely comical role.
